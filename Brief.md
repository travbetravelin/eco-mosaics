# Eco Mosaics — Project Brief

## Business
**Eco Mosaics** — habitat restoration and land management services based on the Northern California coast.

Core focus: creating, restoring, and maintaining mosaic landscapes of diverse, interconnected ecosystems through landscape-scale land management. Thinking across the whole system — riparian zones, coastal scrub, wetland, grassland, oak woodland — not single-species or single-habitat fixes.

## Services

**Current:**
- Habitat Restoration
- Invasive Species Removal
- Beaver Coexistence *(one technique within the broader restoration toolkit, not the headline)*
- Consulting & Assessments

**Future:**
- Prescribed burns (training toward)
- Workshops (hosting or leading)

## Audiences

Two audiences, one site:

- **Clients** — landowners, conservation organizations, public entities (municipalities, agencies)
- **General public** — curious people who want to learn, get involved, or understand ecosystem health; should feel genuinely welcome, not like an afterthought

## Education Mission

A core pillar of the business alongside paid services:
- Spread knowledge about the value of ecosystem health
- Empower people with practical ways to engage with the land — restoration practices, biodiversity support, citizen-level stewardship
- Both "learn from us" (guides, field notes, workshops) and "here's what you can do yourself" (practical, empowering)
- Workshops and field education coming in future

## Site Goals
- Brand awareness
- Book services (landowners, orgs, public entities)
- Educate and engage the general public

## Sitemap
